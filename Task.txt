Fullstack engineer coding task - Backend + Frontend
The task at hand is to create a shirt store.
The overall goal of the assignment is to evaluate the architecture, structure, coding practices
and style. How pretty/ugly it looks is irrelevant.
Backend
- The backend should expose 1 API endpoint that should return data as in this API -
http://mock-shirt-backend.getsandbox.com/shirts . No additional requests will be
required.
Frontend
List page:
- We should have a list page where we see all shirts, no pagination required
- Clicking on a shirt should add the current item to the basket
- If the item is already in the basket, instead of adding it should increase the quantity.
Shopping cart:
- We should display the shopping cart In the top of the page
- It should always show the number of items
- When I click it, it pops up a modal where I can remove items, change items quantity and
see the total price
- The shopping cart state should be persisted to survive page reload
Technicalities:
- Frontend - Angular, Backend - NodeJS (preferably express), DB - up to you
- You may use any additional libraries
- Write 2 unit tests for the backend API
- No need to deploy this online, you can locally run and show us the solution
Please donâ€™t hesitate to ask us if anything is unclear or you have any questions.
In the end just send us the link to the code on Github.
